        How should I model a solar panel with micro-inverters? 
        Should each micro-inverter be a separate asset, or should 
        they be represented as components of the solar panel asset?

        I'm building a monitoring system for a 500kW solar array
        with 1000 panels, each with its own micro-inverter.
        I need to track both panel-level and inverter-level data.

        I tried creating separate asset records for each micro-inverter,
        but that resulted in 1000+ asset records which seems excessive.
        I also considered using the asset hierarchy feature...

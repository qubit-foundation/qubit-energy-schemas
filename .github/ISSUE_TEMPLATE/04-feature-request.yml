      description: What problem does this feature solve?
      placeholder: |
        Currently, developers have to manually check if their API responses
        match the schema format. There's no automated way to validate
        API responses against schemas in a running system.

      required: true

        Create a middleware library that can validate API responses
        against schemas in real-time, with configurable error handling
        and logging of validation failures.

      placeholder: |
        As an API developer, I want to ensure that my energy data API
        always returns data that conforms to the Qubit schemas,
        so that consuming applications can rely on the data structure.
